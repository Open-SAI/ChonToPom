## Chonto Pomodoro Tool ...in bash :P
Yet Another Pomodoro Tool in bash, light, easy, not intrusive, few dependencies (...need to install mplayer to play the ending bell), download and execute, in your local folder, run the bash script with two arguments: minutes to work and a comment or work cicle name in double quotes: 

./chontoBash.sh 25 "My pomodoro cicle"

Chonto will create if no exist a CSV file with four columns: timestamp, minutes worked, comment/task name, Finished (FULL)/Canceled (BREAK). This file can be used to create analytics in other tool.
